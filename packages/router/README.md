# ðŸª¶ @slimr/router [![npm package](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@slimr/router.svg?style=flat-square)](https://npmjs.org/package/@slimr/router)

A tiny alternative to react-router with some novel features like stack routing and scroll restore

Features:

- No dependencies, 3kb min+gziped
- Stack routing -- a route "stack" can have it's own history like react native's react-navigation
- Auto handles all link clicks to same-site and back/popstate without needing to use a Link component
- Fosters/facilitates type-safe linking (no broken links!)
- Attempts to scroll restore -- usually works so long as your pages use stale-while-refresh
- Less is more: faster, less bugs, no breaking changes
- Enhanced lazy-loading -- reduces and sometimes eliminates flicker between route changes
