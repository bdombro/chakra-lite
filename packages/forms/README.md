## API

### FormError

An extension of Error that accepts an `errorSet` as a constructor property. It is used to share error context with `useForm`. When thrown from within an onSubmit handler, `useForm` will set `errorSet` to the `error` state.

```typescript
throw new FormError({form: 'Please add a value for the name field', name: 'This field is required'})
```

### useForm

A hook that returns a Form component and reactive form state.
